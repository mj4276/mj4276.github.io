# Greetings #

I'm a embedded systems and software engineer living in Santa Cruz, CA. I currently work at [Beyond Circuits](https://www.beyond-circuits.com/wordpress/), doing research and development on flow cytometers based around a multi-FPGA system orchestrated from several embedded processors running Linux.

# Everything Else #

I think that describes me about as well as describing a pinot noir as "a liquid derived from grapes".

I have many (maybe too many) hobbies, and I'm interested in just about everything. Lest I accidentally start writing an autobiography, I'll just list a few things I'm enthusiastic about:
- Cycling
- Sailing
- Computers
- Music
- Motorcycles
- Electronics
- Literature
- History

I indend to cover a little bit of it all in the blog!

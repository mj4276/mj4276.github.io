Hello world! I've just finished setting up this blog using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and begun hosting it for free on [GitHub](https://github.com/mj4276).

This is my first dummy post, and you might be my first dummy reader!

Needless to say, neither of us should be terribly proud at this moment, but I hope this will become a fruitful little blog to catalog whatever I find interesting in the coming years.
